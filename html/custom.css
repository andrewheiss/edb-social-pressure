The template inserts CSS in the <head> that adds top-margin: -65px and top-padding: 65px to allow anchored links to show up correctly. But doing that also kills the space before the headings, which is dumb. So here I add 21px/10.5px (the original amounts) of top padding for each heading, on top of the 65px for anchor jumping.  */
